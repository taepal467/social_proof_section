- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)



### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap

### What I learned

*  How to use @media in CSS to resize the web page according to the device that is being used
* Flex box (still learning...)
* Some Bootstrap for sizing up the column width

### Continued development

The areas where I am still struggling are:
* Flexbox
* Bootstrap

I will practice using Flexbox and Bootstrap in future projects to get a better understanding on how to use the to position elements without having to use *margin*, *width*, and *height*

### Useful resources

- [Dillinger.io](https://dillinger.io/) - This helped me to format the markdown used to edit this page.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - I used this website to learn how to use @media in CSS styling and to learn how to add different backgrounds
